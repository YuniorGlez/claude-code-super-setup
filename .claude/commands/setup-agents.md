# Setup AI Agent Team
Use the `agent-architect` to perform a deep analysis of the current project.

Based on your analysis of the code, technology stack, and project structure, and using the available agent templates in `.claude/templates/agents/`, generate the optimal set of specialized sub-agents.

Finally, non-destructively update the `claude.local.md` file with the collaboration protocol so the new agent team can work efficiently and in parallel.
